Sometimes I like to do projects and then post them on the internet for the whole world to benefit!
here's some examples. 

## [AliStim Faces](AliStim.html)

- A set of 100 stimulus identities with 8 emotional expressions each.
- Normalized for size, luminance, and eye location
- Includes ratings of valence, arousal, and categorization accuracy from independent raters.
- Additional self-reported individual difference measures for each stimulus identity can be made available upon request.
